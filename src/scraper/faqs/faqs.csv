P/NP Grading,What is AUBs spring 2020 alternate course grading option?,AUB will apply an alternate course grading option for the spring 2020 term.  This option has been adopted as an exceptional continuity measure to mitigate the effects of the disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and will allow you to choose whether your final course grades for the spring 2020 term are entered as letter/numeric grades or as Pass (P)/ No Pass (NP) in your student record.
P/NP Grading,What does a grade of P mean in the alternate course grading option?,"A grade of P indicates satisfactory performance under circumstance of significant academic disruption. It means that you have successfully completed the course and can count the corresponding course credits as earned. A grade of P also means that you have satisfied minimum grade requirements, as well as requirements to use the course as a prerequisite."
P/NP Grading,What does a grade of NP mean in the alternate course grading option?,A grade of NP indicates a less than satisfactory performance under circumstance of significant academic disruption.  You will not earn credits for a course in which your final grade is NP
P/NP Grading,Can graduate students opt into the alternate course grading option in spring 2020?,Yes. Graduate students can opt into P/NP grading in spring 2020.
P/NP Grading,What is the minimum grade to get a P?,"If you are an undergraduate student, the minimum grade to get a P is 60 or D. If you are a graduate student, the minimum grade to get a P is 70 or C+."
P/NP Grading,Will P or NP enter in the calculation of my GPA?,No. P and NP grades do not enter in the calculation of the GPA.
P/NP Grading,What is the difference between NP and W in the P/NP grading option?,"A W means that you withdrew from a course by the last day for withdrawal from courses, which for spring 2020 is the last day of classes, and before the final course grades have been given. NP indicates that you decided to opt for the alternate course grading option in spring 2020. Neither W nor NP enter in the calculation of your GPA."
P/NP Grading,Is the P/NP grading option mandatory?,"No. If you do not opt into the P/NP grading option by the specified deadline, the default/regular final course grading system, i.e., numeric or letter grading, will be applied."
P/NP Grading,How and when can I decide to opt into P/NP grading?,"After course grades are posted on a special page in AUBsis, you will be given several days to decide whether you want to opt into P/NP grading by completing an online form. The dates for you to fill the online form are currently set for May 22-27, 2020. Once the deadline has passed, there will be no opportunity to change or reverse this decision, even by petition."
P/NP Grading,Can I choose the courses for which the P/NP grading option will apply?,"Yes. You can choose the courses you want to change to P/NP grading, and the courses you want to keep on regular/default (numeric or letter) grading."
P/NP Grading,Is there a limit to the number of courses for which I can opt for P/NP grading in spring 2020?,"While there is no limit to the number of registered courses in spring 2020 for which you can opt for P/NP grading, if you plan to apply for transfer to MSFEA or OSB, then please check their additional requirements for transfer, which are detailed in a different FAQ on this webpage."
P/NP Grading,Can I petition to change a P to a regular numeric or letter grade?,"No. If you opt for the alternate grading option in spring 2020, there will be no opportunity to change a P grade to a regular numeric or letter grade, even by petition."
P/NP Grading,Will I still need to achieve the minimum required average GPA in my minor courses?,"Yes. The average GPA of your minor courses that are graded, i.e., those for which you do not opt for P/NP grading, will need to meet the minimum requirements for the awarding of the minor. Please check the requirements of your minor(s) for the cutoff scores."
P/NP Grading,Can I count courses for which I opt for P/NP grading toward a minor?,Yes. The regulation that minor courses may not be taken on a pass/fail basis at AUB has been waived for spring 2020.
P/NP Grading,I am expecting to graduate with distinction or high distinction by the end of spring 2020. How will opting for P/NP grading affect my chances of achieving this goal?,"The academic regulation on distinction and high distinction is being maintained. You will need to achieve the required minimum GPA to qualify for this honor in your final 60 program credits (with repeated courses included). Nevertheless, any course for which you opt to take a P or NP grade will not be counted in the calculation of the GPA, even as it is counted as part of the total 60 program credits. Because you will see your final grades prior to choosing whether to opt for the P/NP option, you will be able to do the calculation yourself and determine which path is more advantageous for you. Please note that for double degrees, the required minimum GPA threshold must be met for each program separately."
P/NP Grading,I was hoping to make the Deans Honor List in spring 2020. Will the P/NP grading option impact my chances?,The Dean's Honor Lists will be suspended in spring 2020. The extraordinary circumstances and the level of choice being offered to students make it impossible to identify all those who would merit this honor.
P/NP Grading,"I am currently repeating a course and am hoping for a better grade. If I opt for P/NP grading for my repeated course, how will it affect my GPA?","If youre repeating a course for which you have earned a failing (numeric or letter) grade, opting for P/NP grading for that course and earning a P means that you will earn the credits associated with that course. Neither P nor the failing grade will count in the calculation of your cumulative GPA. If, on the other hand, you opt for numeric or letter grades, the higher of the two grades will count in the calculation of your cumulative GPA."
P/NP Grading,I am on probation this term and was hoping to be in good standing for fall 2020. Can I opt for P/NP grading for any of my classes and be removed from probation for the fall?,"Yes. If you're an undergraduate student who's currently on probation, your probation can be removed if you attain the required term average using at least 12 credits (of the total number of credits you have registered for in spring 2020) for which you opt to earn numeric or letter grades. Courses with a P or NP final grade will not count in the calculation of the term GPA.

In no case will being on probation in spring 2020 count toward dismissal, i.e., when an undergraduate student has been on academic probation four (4) times or has failed to clear probation after two (2) terms.

If you're a graduate student, follow the university and faculty/school guidelines as listed in the graduate catalog for the removal of probation. Courses with a P or NP final grade will not be counted in the calculation of the term GPA. In no case will being on probation in spring 2020 count toward dismissal."
P/NP Grading,Can I be put on probation based on my performance in spring 2020?,"No. AUB has decided to suspend determination of academic standing vis--vis probation based on your performance during this term. If you were in good standing this term, you will be in good standing in the fall 2020 term. If your performance leaves you uneasy, please ensure you speak with your advisor about your concerns and your schedule for the fall."
P/NP Grading,I am a masters student who is benefiting from the Graduate Fellowship and Assistantship Program (GFAP) during spring 2020; will opting for the P/NP grading option for any of my courses impact my GA percentage allocation for next term?,"No. The GA percentage allocation for continuing master's students will not be reduced for next term (summer 2020 or fall 2020) if they opt for P/NP grading in spring 2020. However, the GA percentage allocation may be reduced for other reasons, such as existing guidelines at the level of the program/department or lack of funding.  "
P/NP Grading,"If I choose numeric or letter grades for courses during spring 2020, will these be considered as part of the average GPA for my application to masters or PhD studies at AUB?",Yes. Courses with numeric or letter grade during spring 2020 will be taken into account in the evaluation of applications submitted to graduate programs for fall 2020.
P/NP Grading,"I am studying abroad in spring 2020. My host university is offering an alternative grading option (e.g., P/NP or P/F, etc.). Will I be able to receive credit for my courses, if I opt for the alternative grading option at my host university?","If you earn a P (or equivalent in the host institution alternative grading option) on a pre-approved course you are taking in spring 2020 as part of your study abroad program, you will be able to receive credit for it."
P/NP Grading,I want to apply to transfer programs. How will opting for P/NP grading in spring 2020 impact the success of my application?,"Opting for P/NP grading does not affect the eligibility criteria for transfer for freshman, sophomore, and above. The minimum required GPA will be calculated over available graded courses. Individual course requirements will be considered met if you earn a P in those courses. Transfer admission remains competitive: it is limited by the number of spaces available and a number of Faculties/Schools have additional transfer requirements. If you plan to transfer to one of these Faculties/Schools in fall 2020-21, you must satisfy the following additional requirements:  
MSFEA:
A minimum of 10 credits of graded courses in math and sciences for freshman transfer to engineering majors.
A minimum of 12 credits of graded courses in math and sciences, for sophomore or higher transfer to engineering majors.
A minimum of 18 credits of graded courses for freshman or higher transfer to architecture or graphic design.
OSB: 
A minimum overall GPA of 75 or 2.7 calculated from graded courses for freshman or higher. 
For sophomore or higher, students who do not have an overall GPA of 75 or 2.7, must have a minimum GPA of 77 or 2.9 in at least three of the following business courses: ACCT 210, FINA 210, INFO 200, DCSN 200, MNGT 215, MKTG 210, ACCT 215, DCSN 205 and BUSS 215.

That said, if you plan to apply for transfer, you are strongly advised to discuss your options with your advisor, especially if you are a freshman student."
P/NP Grading,NEW! Will opting for the alternate course grading option in spring 2020 negatively affect my financial aid?,"No. AUBs financial aid policy states that to qualify for financial aid, you must be in good standing and carry a credit load of at least twelve credits for undergraduate students and three credits for graduate students. Because you will not be put on probation based on your performance this term, if you already have financial aid, opting for the alternate course grading option will not negatively affect your financial aid going forward to 2020-21 as long as you remain full time and no other financial aid restriction applies to you (see p. 8 of the policy). If you are on probation and are hoping to qualify for financial aid in 2020-21, there is a specific FAQ that addresses how the alternate course grading option could affect your ability to come off probation."
Registration issues,Is the withdrawal deadline still April 9th?,"No. The last day to withdraw from courses for spring 2020 is the last day of classes, which is currently May 2nd."
Graduate studies,Can I defend my masters or PhD thesis in spring 2020 using an online video conferencing platform?,"Yes. You can defend you master's or PhD thesis via online video conferencing. As usual, the thesis defense will be open to the public and announced ahead of time. For this term, we are waiving the requirement that it should be announced at least two weeks in advance. "
Graduate studies,What platforms are recommended to organize an online thesis defense?,"The university supports live video conferencing sessions via WebEx. The thesis advisor should configure the session in order to create an invitation link. More details on the configuration process are available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cKce6Jm7UE. For additional support, please contact IT Helpdesk it.helpdesk@aub.edu.lb"
Graduate studies,How do I secure the needed signatures after the defense?,The advisor can replace the required signatures on the thesis defense form by email confirmations from the thesis committee members.
Graduate studies,"How can students deposit a copy of their thesis, dissertation, or project (all referred to as ""Thesis"") at the Jafet Memorial Library if they plan to graduate in spring 2020?","A student who is using Word to prepare the Thesis should first e-mail the Library a file containing the preliminary pages, table of contents, one chapter with headings, and the bibliography to ensure that all are correctly formatted. After confirmation from the Library that all is correct, the student should e-mail the complete Thesis to the Library as a Word file for final Library approval. If using Latex/Overleaf software, the student should e-mail the Library the complete Thesis as a PDF file for final Library approval. 
Once the Library provides the final approval, the student should sign the Thesis Release Form, and secure the signatures of the advisor(s) and committee members on the Thesis Approval Page. The student's Thesis advisor or Department should then send an e-mail to the Library, verifying the completion of all requirements.  
As a final step, the student should deposit the Thesis in AUB ScholarWorks as a complete PDF file, which will include signed copies of the Thesis Release Form and the Thesis Approval Page. Upon deposit of the digital copy of the Thesis in AUB ScholarWorks, an online receipt will be submitted by the Library to the Office of the Registrar. For more information, check the Thesis Manual.
