The  course  introduces  students  to  the  basic  principles  of  designing  with  plants. 
Landscape Architecture combines elements of art and science to create a functional, 
aesthetic and spatial experience of the outdoor space. One initial purpose of designing 
with  plants  is  to  understand  how  to  blend  technology  (the  built  environment)  into 
the  natural  surroundings  and  to  bring  natural  elements  into  the  built  environment. 
In order to work toward a desirable landscape design and hence successful planting 
plan, students will develop working knowledge of artistic elements, design principles 
and  basic  horticultural  knowledge  of  plants.  Successful  plant  composition  and 
layout  is  obtained  with  acknowledgement  of  the  importance  of  plants  as  a  design 
material  that  enhances  the  definition  and  spatial  experience  of  outdoor  spaces.

By  their  nature,  urban  environments  have  multiple  layers  and  meanings  and  are 
influenced by an array of forces. Urban landscapes are an amalgam of myriad social, 
cultural, political, economic and ecological processes on physical space. Designing in 
the urban context therefore requires sensitivity to these many layers and influences.

This course aims at providing architecture students with a comprehensive understanding 
of the basics of black and white and color photography, its techniques and aesthetics. 
Students  learn  how  to  use  their  cameras  and  light  meters  and  are  taught,  through 
hands-on  practice,  the  fundamentals  needed  in  traditional  black  and  white  printing 
in  the  darkroom.  The  course  includes  slide  lectures  and  discussions  around  the 
works  of  classic  masters  and  contemporary  experts  of  the  medium,  field  trips,  as 
well as presentations by well-established photographers specializing in architectural 
photography.

Although  utopia  does  not  belong  to  a  particular  field  of  research,  it  often  relates  to 
architecture, representing a delicate discrepancy between ‘ideals’ and ‘space.’ It has 
always been the concern of architects and designers to imagine utopias, so much so 
that the history of architecture may no longer ignore this literature and abundant work 
that relates the sociopolitical and economic field to spatial manifestations of desires 
and dreams.

The Black Box is a workshop and seminar open to architecture, graphic design and other 
students. Class meets once a week. Metaphorically, the black box stands for a hiding 
device that creates a feeling of curiosity and triggers imagination. This seminar is an 
exploration, interaction and experimentation with the concept of the black box through 
the three sub-themes of Desire, Imagination and the Unseen. Students are invited to 
respond  to  contemporary  artistic  works  (cinema,  architecture,  literature)  as  well  as 
to present their own through the media of photography, script-writing and projection. 
Prerequisite: Advanced standing.

The  course  aims  to  present  contemporary  scenography  as  a  comprehensive  spatial 
art  form  rather  than  merely  a  decorative  tool.  As  such  the  course  will  focus  on  the 
inherent  transformative  and  performance  processes  of  contemporary  scenography. 
The spectrum of scenography today ranges from theater scenography to performance 
design,  exhibition  scenography,  film/media  scenography  as  well  as  urban  and/or 
natural environments. This has proven to be, and to contain, an incomparable potential 
for a very rich interaction between theatrical space and the actors/audience.

The goal of this class is to explore, practice and theorize the form of the portfolio (more 
broadly understood as the work of creative individuals representing themselves) in order 
to gain a certain level of mastery over the process of presentation and representation 
of previously produced work. Through a theoretical, analytical and practical process of 
reading, looking and producing visual, textual and multimedia material, students will 
gain exposure to the global culture of the making of portfolios and practical knowledge 
in  the  production  of  such  (physical  or  online)  representational  artifacts.  Ultimately, 
this workshop will raise and investigate the complex and never-ending issue of self-
representation, the portfolio obviously being an autobiography of sorts.

Micro  Devices  is  a  course  that  teaches  visualization  and  diagramming  as  analytical 
methods  to  pursue  research  on  a  specific  local  infrastructural  problematic  (water, 
transportation, energy, etc.). The aim is to rigorously tackle that infrastructural issue 
through mapping and diagramming to produce a visual pamphlet while proposing hybrid 
and speculative design interventions.

This course teaches students the fundamental principles of silkscreen printing and to 
be creative in their approach to printmaking. Silkscreen, one of the most versatile and 
widely used methods of printmaking, will be fully explored in this studio class through 
demonstrations and self-initiated projects. Students will be encouraged to experiment 
with multiple techniques and combinations of traditional and contemporary methods of 
serigraphy, and search for solutions that best translate the nature of their work to the 
medium. Prerequisites: GRDS 214, ARCH 112 or FAAH 202; and FAAH 234.

The course is divided into three parts. The first few weeks cover the different kinds of 
paper in a historical narrative. They also explain papermaking and methods of dividing 
sheets  with  and  without  the  use  of  rulers  and  cutters.  A  project  will  be  launched 
assessing understanding of the historical tools used to make paper before proceeding 
into  the  second  phase.  While  the  second  part  is  geared  towards  experimentation  in 
creating more than one type of paper in the traditional sense, the third part involves 
making one’s own paper using the more traditional techniques learned.

This course is an introduction to the fundamentals of intaglio printmaking processes. 
It covers the non-acid methods such as engraving, dry point and mezzotint and acid 
methods like etching (hard and soft ground) and aquatint. This studio art course covers 
the needed technical information; however, emphasis will not only be placed on the 
technical production of art works but also on the content and concepts of printmaking.

ARCH,023,"The  distinction  between  urban,  suburban  and  rural  is  increasingly  blurred.  New 
patterns of physical urbanization and growing environmental concerns are challenging 
the conventional approach of urban design in thinking about and shaping city space. 
Emerging disciplines, such as landscape design and landscape urbanism, are providing 
alternative  ways  of  conceptualizing  that  stress  ecology  over  morphology;  network 
surface  over  urban  form;  and  the  confluence  of  architecture,  landscape,  city  and 
infrastructure. This course explores the changing conception of city space examining 
the shifts in urban design theory and practice. The course will appeal to students in

This course presents various aspects (mainly physical and social) of regional architecture 
in Lebanon, covering a period of over a century and a half (1820-1970). It introduces 
students to various typologies of local architecture, based on case studies of the city 
of Beirut as well as other rural areas in Lebanon. It also examines the importance of 
heritage architecture in shaping urban neighborhoods and socio-spatial practices and 
introduces urban renewal strategies in areas facing various forms of dilapidation.

At the cusp of a new digital era, that of the parametric, laden with scripted form and built 
with a combination of digital and manual fabrication tools, this seminar will consider 
the production of architecture in the past two decades in search of formal tendencies–
tropes or systems—that have been repeatedly utilized in the production of contemporary 
architecture. By categorically identifying these ‘tropes,’ the overarching pedagogical 
agenda of this seminar is to enable students to develop tectonic and formal literacy. The 
first part of this seminar will involve a survey of contemporary architecture in order to 
identify and categorize recurring formal tropes while introducing students to a thematic 
lexicon  in  contemporary  architecture.  The  second  part  of  the  seminar  will  include 
projective and analytical diagramming of select buildings in order to identify part-to-
whole  relationships  as  generative  tools  in  production  of  contemporary  architecture 
while investigating the possibilities of genealogical relationships within the categories.

The  course  will  expose  students  to  housing  typology,  the  study  of  housing  types, 
through the intensive use of drawing as a critical tool of analysis and representation. 
Housing types will be analyzed using key local and global case studies drawn from the 
histories of architecture. Types are understood as distinct architectural inventions that 
are open to change and mutation. Questions related to the shifting boundaries between 
private and public, changing demographics, work/life patterns, climatic response and 
affordable housing will be addressed through the transformations of type.

reconstruction give rise to cinematic representations. We will also look at how discourses 
of cinema and their production and design process affect architecture, urbanism and 
our experiences in the city. In addition, through a workshop, we will get our hands dirty 
with cameras and experiment with a few short clips ourselves.

Architect Renzo Piano once said that “Architecture is an art of borders.” This course 
offers students a space to think about their practice as architects in relation to borders. 
The  “art  of  borders”  will  be  negotiated,  agreed  or  disagreed  upon,  generating  other 
statements  that  relate  architecture  to  borders.  Students  will  read  about  spatial  and 
conceptual  borders.  We  will  analyze  geopolitical  borders  (Nation  theory,  Pan  Arab 
scheme, European Union, the United States of America, Brexit, etc.), conflict borders 
(Separation Wall in Palestine, Tiran and Sanafir islands, Solidere, etc.), climate borders 
(hotels, malls, gated communities, etc.) as well as borders between disciplines, ideas 
and genres. Students will reflect on Piano’s quote through researching, practicing and 
subverting it to deepen their awareness of their impact on how people move in space.

This course explores cities after war by investigating the evolution of reconstruction 
interventions on devastated landscapes in the US, Europe and the Middle East from 
WWI until the present. The focus will be on Lebanon as a primary laboratory of postwar 
reconstruction in the 1990s and 2000s, from which to explore, evaluate and generalize. 
The  two  poles  of  investigation  are:  morphologies  of  destruction  and  dialectics  of 
reconstruction, emphasizing four generic geospatial contexts: 1) urban central district 
restoration, 2) suburban neighborhood rebuilding, 3) refugee camp reconstruction and 
4) rural landscape recovery.

The  course  will  investigate  the  developed  techniques  and  creative  design  in  Earth 
architecture, from brick to city making. We will examine natural materials: stone, mud 
brick  (baked  and  sundried),  pisé  or  rammed  earth,  salt,  coral  rock  and  shale.  This 
architecture was integral to the environment and settlement patterns (urban and rural) 
of different cities, towns and villages, hence its considerable ecological and sustainable 
impact. The course is based on first-hand materials, projects and living examples from 
contemporary sites across the region (Spain, Morocco to the Indian subcontinent) and 
modern earth projects globally.

This course inquires how we, as artists, designers, writers and makers, can critically, 
meaningfully and admittedly leisurely turn towards conflict. It is a seminar class in the 
history/theory category. It will therefore develop from student-led presentations and 
in-depth discussions of a complex set of overlapping topics: aesthetics and politics, 
poetics,  representations  of  violence  and  other  relevant  themes  that  will  organically 
emerge throughout the term based on the students’ research interests.

The term branding as we understand it today is a relatively recent development in the 
history  of  what  is  more  classically  referred  to  as  identity  design.  Whether  the  more 
widespread term “corporate identity” which is rooted in the American business model, 
or the more form-focused “visual identity” – indentité visuelle – as European designers 
would say, such terms seem to fall short in describing the contemporary version of the 
practice and are systematically being replaced by the “branding” standard, l’image de 
marque.

Design and technology studies in schools of architecture are based on the making of 
things, how they perform in the environment, the experience of the results and their 
cognitive  interpretation.  The  scientific  knowledge  and  technical  expertise  available 
for  architecture  are  extensive  and  their  rate  of  change  is  substantial.  The  course 
seeks to develop the ability to learn how to learn, a vital necessity for innovation. The 
teaching focus is on craftsmanship, innovation, conceptual and lateral thinking, new 
technologies, construction, interdisciplinary work and collaboration with industries.

The course introduces students to alternative ways in starting a design project, whether 
an object, an installation or a building. It is mainly a hands-on set of small exercises, 
through  modeling,  observing  and  description  in  a  lab-like  manner.  Through  these 
exercises,  students  will  slowly  discover  how  a  ready-made  can  influence,  guide  and 
affect the course of evolution of a project and help in generating new ideas. The ready-
made  is  a  mindset  preparation  that  will  allow  students  to  deconstruct  preconceived 
ideas about design putting aside all a priori. The aim of such a methodology, that seems 
unrelated to the subject, will unknowingly allow them to lose their familiarity with the 
“project-to-be” and see it under a new light. This confrontational process has proven 
to be a dialectical tool that can be applied to any scale from a small object to an urban 
scale project. It is a method of work, a line of thought, a new line of investigation.

set forth a revolution in the way we make buildings, where the process of making has 
radically  changed  from  the  traditional  sequence  of  design-analyze-build  to  a  more 
interactive  and  integrative  process  that  intercrosses  analytical  tools  with  design, 
simulation and fabrication.

printing methods both high- and low-end as well as high- and low-tech, students will 
explore the ways in which serial media and other types of publications provide an outlet 
for personal expression. Students will be expected to view this class not as a ‘how-to’ 
but as a ‘have to’, and they should be prepared to engage politically, socially, culturally, 
poetically, narratively, but most of all personally.

This  course  is  about  the  various  methods  of  enquiry  and  interpretation  used  in 
anthropological research. Though ethnographic methods are shaped by each research 
situation and its particular historical and cultural circumstances, they are also guided by 
broad theoretical questions. This course takes the perspective that research is comprised 
of  three  interrelated  domains:  creative  theoretical  speculation,  methodological 
‘operationalization’ of theoretical questions and concrete research practices. The trick 
(or ‘magic’) of ethnographic research is to relate empirical and observational data in 
many forms to the theories that motivate their collection. We explore the politics and 
ethics of research, kinds of observation, effective interviewing strategies, note-taking, 
conducting surveys, examining archives, ways of ‘coding’ or indexing information, data 
analysis and approaches to writing. Annually.

in the program or obtain the consent of the course instructor and program chair. The 
core courses are designed to include remedial preparation in social science. This will 
enable the waiver of social science prerequisites for students who join from sciences, 
math, business or engineering majors. BA holders from the economics major may not 
need  remedial  courses  beyond  the  core  energy  science  course.  Students  from  other 
social science majors or arts may be required to take one or more remedial courses over 
and above program requirements as would be recommended by the chair of the program 
upon admissions. Suggested remedial courses for BA holders are PHYS 210, MATH 201 
or Math 204, and STAT 201 or their equivalents. These remedial courses are part of the 
general education requirements of most universities. The prerequisites by topic include:
